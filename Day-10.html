The earliest reference to Pune is an inscription on a Rashtrakuta Dynasty copper plate dated 937 CE, which refers to the town as Punya-Vishaya, meaning 'sacred news'.[28] By the 13th century, it had come to be known as Punawadi.
During the Rashtrakuta dynasty, the city was referred to as Punnaka and Punyapur. The copper plates of 758 and 768 CE show that the Yadava dynasty had renamed the city Punakavishaya and Punya Vishaya. 'Vishaya' means land, and 'Punaka' and 'Punya' mean holy. The city was known as Kasbe Pune when under the command of Maratha king Shivaji's father, Shahaji. Mughal emperor Aurangzeb renamed a small neighbourhood in central part of the old city as Muhiyabad (the only divergent naming) some time between 1703 and 1705 in memory of his great-grandson Muhi-ul-Milan, who died there. The name Muhiyabad was reverted back soon after Aurangzeb's death.[15] Anglicized to Poona in 1857 by the English during British rule, the city's name was changed to Pune in 1978.Marathi is the official and most-spoken language. Pune, being the cultural capital of Maharashtra, is a centre for Marathi literature and its dialect forms the basis for the written standard of Marathi. As a destination for migrants throughout India, Hindi is also widely-spoken, as is Dakhni Urdu by the Muslim community. Gujarati and Marwari are spoken by the business community.

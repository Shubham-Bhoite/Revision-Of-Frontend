<div class="div1" id="div-one">Here is a comprehensive overview of Narendra Modi, his early life, political career, and impact on Indian governance.Narendra Damodardas Modi was born in Vadnagar, a small town in Gujarat, India. His family belonged to the Ghanchi community, and Modi grew up in humble surroundings. As a young boy, he helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, an experience that later became a symbol of his connection to the common people. Modi's early years were marked by a strong work ethic and a desire to contribute to society.</div> 
<div class="div2" id="div-two">Modi's entry into politics began with his association with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist organization. He later joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and rose through the ranks. In 2001, he became the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a position he held until 2014. His tenure as Chief Minister was marked by both praise and criticism. While Gujarat experienced significant economic development under his leadership, the state also faced criticism for its handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots. </div>In 2014, Narendra Modi led the BJP to a decisive victory in the general elections, securing a majority in the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament).He assumed office as the Prime Minister of India on May 26, 2014, with a mandate for economic development, good governance, and anti-corruption measures.While Modi enjoys widespread popularity, he has also faced criticism on various fronts.

    <p>Lord Rama, also known as Shree Ram, is a revered figure in Hinduism and a central character in the epic Ramayana. Born to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya in Ayodhya, <b>Rama is considered the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu.</b> His life exemplifies the principles of dharma (righteousness) and devotion.</p>
    <br>
    <u>Rama's story revolves around his exile to the forest for 14 years, accompanied by his wife Sita and loyal brother Lakshmana. The narrative unfolds the abduction of Sita by the demon king Ravana, leading to a war between Rama and Ravana.</u> <hr>Guided by his unwavering commitment to righteousness, Rama, with the help of the monkey-god Hanuman and an army of monkeys, ultimately defeats Ravana and rescues Sita.
    <i>The significance of Rama's life extends beyond religious boundaries, as his virtues of compassion, integrity, and duty inspire millions.</i> Celebrated during the festival of Diwali, Rama's tale symbolizes the triumph of good over evil and serves as a timeless source of moral guidance. <s>Devotees chant the mantra "Jai Shree Ram" to express reverence for Lord Rama, embodying the enduring values that his life represents.</s>
